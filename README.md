# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built using Python's `Tkinter` library for the GUI. The game allows a player to compete against a computer and set the number of rounds needed to win.

## Features

- Set a custom score to win the game.
- Play against a computer opponent.
- Display the result of each match (win, lose, or tie).
- Ability to play again or exit after a game ends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter library (usually included with standard Python installation).

## How to Play

1. **Set the Winning Score**: Enter the number of rounds required to win in the input field on the starting screen, then click **Start**.
   
2. **Make Your Move**: Choose either **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking the respective button.

3. **See the Result**: The game will display the robot's move and the result (whether you won, lost, or tied) after each round.

4. **Win or Lose**: Once either the player or the robot reaches the set winning score, the winner is displayed on a separate screen.

5. **Play Again or Exit**: After a game ends, you can either click **Play Again** to reset the game or **Exit** to close the application.
